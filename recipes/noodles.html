    <h2 class="heading">Why buttered noodles?</h2>
    <p>
      Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.
