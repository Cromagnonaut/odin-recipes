    <h2>Stuffed flatbread with potatoes</h2>

    <p>
      This cheese and potato-stuffed flatbread begins with a simple, unleavened dough, is filled with potato and 3 kinds of cheese, and cooks on the stovetop. If you enjoyed our Khachapuri, which is a Georgian-style cheese-stuffed bread, and you love potato, this really should be the next thing you make.
